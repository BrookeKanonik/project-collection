## E-Commerce Website (ecom folder)

Interactive e-commerce website built with react and django that uses a PAYPAL API. Admins can add products, update shipping for customer's orders and more! Customers can see when items are out of stock, rate products, and pay for goods with either PAYPAL or a credit card.

## Lets Make It, Chef ( -- IN PROGRESS, LARGE PROJECT )

## Movie Finder (movie-finder folder)

Using a large mongoDB database, users can type a movie into a search bar and it will autocomplete to guess what movie you are trying to look up! Fuzzy search is also implemented for 2 characters.
