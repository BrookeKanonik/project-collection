# Collection of My Projects

## E-Commerce Website (ecom folder)

Interactive e-commerce website built with react and django that uses a PAYPAL API. Admins can add products, update shipping for customer's orders and more! Customers can see when items are out of stock, rate products, and pay for goods with either PAYPAL or a credit card.

## Nasa Image/Video Projector (nasa folder)

Users may select a date (current or in the past) and either an image or video will populate along with the description of said item.

## Quote Generator (quote-generator folder)

Small quote generator regarding Pompompurin created for my niece since we both love Sanrio characters. 

## Star Wars CRUD Project (star-wars-crud folder) 

CRUD project where users can add quotes said by their favorite character, turn a Yoda quote into a Darth Vader quote, or delete a Darth Vader quote (incase there's too much of the dark side on the page)!
